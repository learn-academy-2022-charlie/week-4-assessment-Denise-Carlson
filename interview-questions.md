# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props is actually a keyword for properties in React. This is how an object in react gets passed down to the child through inheritance. react uses states to interact with the DOM. During my time as a developer, I have used props to pass down attributes from the parent to the child objects. While properties or props are static they are used with state and super()along with this.object to affect changes on the DOM or document object model which react uses.

  Researched answer: Props are read-only and they are passed to components using HTML attributes.
React props are like function arguments in javascript and attributes in HTML according to W3schools I found this comparison useful for my understanding of this concept.


2. What is a DOM event?
A DOM event refers to any action that effects the DOM or document object model. DOM events are referred to as lifecycle events and they occur anytime there is interaction with the DOM. When a object is mounted to the DOM this is referred to as birth, the beginning of the object becoming a node on the DOM. After an object is mounted, it can be altered,deleted ,updated etc. all these actions are also DOM events. During my time as a developer, I have interacted with the DOM and I understand the importance of making sure that changes to the DOM are done correctly and with the right formatting and syntax.
  Your answer: My answer didn't include HTML DOM event objects which allow javascript to register different event handlers on elements within an HTML document. An example is the button element in HTML that doesn't happen until the button is clicked. With JSX in react, you can pass a function as an event handler instead of a string.

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object Orientated Programming deals with objects and utilizing object properties, methods and other ways to interact with the object. In ruby programming everything including all the data types are objects. Functional programming is based on functions or reusable bits of code that are able to be manipulated through various means. As a developer I have spent the majority of my time with object orientated programming it is more intuitive while functional programming is more logical. There is some overlap with most languages even object oriented ones. It is best to learn both kinds because depending on the situation, it can often be approached in different ways and different languages to solve any given problem or issue. Being open to new ideas and ways of solving problems is key for great software development.

  Researched answer: 

functional emphasizes the declarative programming model. OOP uses imperative. In functional programming variables and functions are the main elements of code. OOP uses objects and methods.Functional programming like R language is great for data science. It can be efficient and use nested functions which can be re-used.

4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?
A float is a decimal number while a integer is a whole number or negative number. Often in programming especially when dealing with currency, you may want to limit the float or even eliminate it. Dealing with more than 2 decimal places can be difficult and Ruby allows some built in math methods like Math.floor to round up those float numbers. Both floats and integers are objects in Ruby language.

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Methods like even and odd check work on integers, while methods like ceil and floor take floats and return as integers. Some methods like round and times use both integers and floats. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?
In most languages like javascript, SQL, Java once you declare a function you have to use return to state what will happen once the function is called or invoked. Ruby is very user friendly language and accepts alot of different formats to make it easier to switch between when programming in different languages. The implicit return means the developer in Ruby doesn't have to write return when calling or invoking a function. The return is implied and automatically occurs once you write the function in ruby. As a developer I appreciate the user-friendly aspect of ruby and  the implicit return is helpful.

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: The implicit return does have one drawback in that it only executes the value returned by the last statement.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Variable defined in a class. Every object of that class has a copy of it.

2. PostgreSQL: This language is based on SQL and is used in databases for making structures like tables and doing queries. Open source relational database which supports SQL and JSON. used as a database for many applications and uses 

3. Ruby on Rails: A backend framework built on Ruby.
Contains everything needed to make a database-backed web application using model view controller or MVC pattern. Allows use of JSON, XML as well as HTML, CSS and javascript for user interfaces.
4. ORM: Object relational mapping. Allows you to write and manipulate data from a database using OOP paradigm. Objects are used to connect SQL and OOP concepts. An example is Django. ORM's map to tables in the database virtually. 

5. Active Record: The model in MVC which is responsible for representing business data and logic. It provides an OOP interface for databases. A record class is associated with a database table.
